Code Bank Descriptions:
**Call_Center_and_Employee_Data** - Code that was used to build the data for the tactical call center dashboard. A good example of data simulation.<br>

**RFM_Data_and_Grouping** - Code that was used to build the data for the strategic RFM dashboard. Good examples of data simulation and structuring data for a specific use case.<br>

**Sierpinski_Triangle** - An R script for a function that can be used to draw Sierpinski Triangles using the Chaos Game method. This is a good example of functional coding, custom error messages, and omplementing random processes for simulation.
